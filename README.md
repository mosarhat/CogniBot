# Discord Bot Using DeepSeek

A simple Discord bot that takes the DeepSeek API, and serves it in my personal Discord server.

I used the following repository to help me structure the directory: https://github.com/LachlanDev/Discord-BOT-Template?tab=readme-ov-file.

## Setup
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install The ```discord.js``` Library

```bash
npm install discord.js
```
3. Install a linter. This will allow the code to be consistent throughout.

```bash
npm install --save-dev eslint @eslint/js
```

From here, we need to set-up a configuration file in our directory called eslint.config.js, and set rules for it. The following website is the ruleset I'll use: https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-linter.html#installing-a-linter.

4. Added my bot token to ```config.json```.
5. Run ```npm start``` to start the bot..
